### The Interface: An Overview

The user interface is designed to be intuitive on any device.

#### Desktop View
The screen is split into two main panels:
*   **Control Panel (Left):** This is your creative workspace. Here you'll find all the options to enter your content, use templates, and customize the design of your QR code.
*   **Preview Panel (Right):** This area shows a live, high-quality preview of your QR code as you make changes. It also contains the download and share buttons.

#### Mobile View
On mobile, the controls and preview are stacked vertically for easy access:
*   **Control Area (Top):** All the forms and customization options are at the top of the screen.
*   **Action Bar (Bottom):** After you generate a QR code, a sticky action bar appears at the bottom. This bar contains the **Download**, **Share**, and **Show/Hide Preview** buttons for easy access without having to scroll.

### Creating a QR Code: A Step-by-Step Guide

Creating a QR code is a simple three-step process.

#### Step 1: Select Data Type
At the top of the control panel, use the dropdown menu labeled **"1. Select Data Type"** to choose what kind of information your QR code will hold. Options include:
*   **URL:** Link to a website.
*   **Text:** Display plain text.
*   **vCard:** Create a digital contact card.
*   **WiFi:** Let others connect to your WiFi network easily.
*   And many more, including Email, Phone, Social Media, and App Stores!

#### Step 2: Enter Content
A form will appear based on the data type you selected. Fill in the required information. For example, if you chose "URL," you will see a field to enter the website address.
> **Privacy First!** Right below the "Generate" button, you'll see our privacy promise: *"The Truly Private QR Code Generator."* This is to assure you that we never see, save, or track the data you enter. It stays on your device.

#### Step 3: Generate the Code
Click the large **"Generate QR Code"** button. Your QR code will instantly appear in the preview panel on the right (desktop) or in the preview area at the bottom (mobile).

### Using Templates for Quick Designs

Want a professional-looking QR code in seconds? Use a template!
1.  Scroll down to the **"Start with a Template"** section.
2.  Click on any of the pre-designed options like "YouTube," "Instagram," "Restaurant," or "Love Letter."
3.  The template will be instantly applied to your QR code, setting the colors, logo, and frame for you. You can then customize it further if you wish.

### Customizing Your QR Code

Make your QR code unique using the customization tabs.

*   **Colors & Logo:** Change the color of the QR code and its background. You can also add a logo from our list of popular icons (like Facebook, Twitter) or upload your own by selecting the **"Custom"** option.
*   **Frame:** Add a stylish frame around your code with a call-to-action message like "SCAN ME" or "FOLLOW US."
*   **Shape:** Change the style of the QR code's "dots" from the default squares to rounded squares or circles.
*   **Quality (Error Correction):** This determines how much of the QR code can be damaged or covered (e.g., by your logo) and still be readable. **This is set to "High" automatically when you add a logo.**

### Downloading and Sharing Your QR Code

Once you are happy with your design, use the buttons in the preview panel (desktop) or the bottom action bar (mobile).

*   **Download:** Click the "Download" button to open a menu with several format options:
    *   **PNG:** A standard image file, perfect for web use or documents.
    *   **SVG:** A vector file that can be scaled to any size without losing quality. Ideal for professional printing or graphic design.
    *   **PDF:** A standard document file for easy sharing and printing.

*   **Share:** Click the "Share" button to use your device's native sharing options. This is a quick way to send the code via email, text message, or social media.

*   **Show/Hide Preview (Mobile Only):** On mobile, the QR code preview can sometimes cover the content creation area. Simply tap the **"Hide"** button to collapse the preview and get it out of the way. Tap **"Show"** to see it again.
